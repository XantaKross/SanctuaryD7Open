NAME: Common functions file.
PURPOSE: Has all the common functions that will be used by various functions throughout darwin.

1) Class: Bubble;
Idea: This acts as a two way dictionary or linked lists.
of the formatting,

[key1, key2, key3 ...] <---> [value1, value2, value3, ...]
        'A'                             'B'


whereby any values in A can lead to B and vice versa.

Inner Functions:
1)) init     (self): initialises the key and value lists, along with a common index list.
2)) add      (key, value): adds new key-value pair to the end of lists.
3)) retrieve (key_or_value, tag): when tag==1; it retrieves index value of key or value
                                  when tag==0; it retrieves value if given is key or key if given is value.
4)) print_obj (self):  prints the bubble object in proper formatting.


2) Function: purify(string);
Idea: Takes a string and removes certain specific things from it. Hence "purifies" the string.

3) Function: find_func(list);
Idea: returns the "key" attribute of a key-value from list, whose value is the highest.

4) Function: Compress(list);
Idea: Takes a multi-dimension list and compresses it to a single dimension.
that is,

takes matrix (2D) (NxM sized) -----> creates vector (1D) (N*M x 1 sized)

5) Function: Merge(dict1, dict2);
Idea: Merges two Dictionaries.

6) Function: check_run(file_name, function_name, user_command, current_time_details);
Idea: extracts a given function from a python file, then injects the function with parameters
then runs in the terminal and finally returns a string output that is obtained from runnning the function.
